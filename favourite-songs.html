      <h1>Horror Vacui: One of my favourite bands</h1>
      <p>
        The first song I ever heard from Horror Vacui was "<em
          >New Wave Of Fear</em
        >" from their 2018 album "<em>New Wave Of Fear</em>" back in June 2021.
        I listened to a few of their songs through the summer and then in
        October I started to listen to them nonstop. The reason they are my one
        of my favourite bands is because of the angsty, angry and just feel of
        the music they release. From the vocals to the instrumentals theres just
        something so good about just everything. Horror Vacui is also what made
        me start thinking about and realizing that this was the subculture I
        belonge to which hadn't happened before. In general the band members
        seem to care about their fans and just seem like pretty cool
        individuals.
